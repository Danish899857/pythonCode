Introduction:
In this report, we will be discussing the implementation of a "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game using the Python programming language. The game is a simple one that follows the basic rules of the classic game in which rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. The game allows the player to make their choice and the computer will make a random choice. The winner is then determined by comparing the choices and a message is displayed indicating the outcome.

Implementation:
The first step in the implementation was to define the rules of the game, which are: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. Next, the input() function was used to prompt the player for their choice, which was then stored in a variable for later use. The random module was used to generate a random choice for the computer.

A set of conditions was created to determine the winner of the game using if and elif statements. These conditions compare the player's choice and the computer's choice and determine the winner based on the rules defined earlier. If the player's choice is the same as the computer's choice, the game is a tie. If the player's choice beats the computer's choice, the player wins, and if the computer's choice beats the player's choice, the computer wins.

The results of the game are printed using the print() function, which is used to display the outcome of the game.

An option to play the game again was added by using a loop that allows the player to play again, if they want. The player is prompted to indicate whether they want to play again by using the input() function, and if they respond with "yes," the game loop starts again. Otherwise, the game exits.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game has been implemented using Python. The game follows the basic rules of the classic game and allows the player to make a choice and the computer makes a random choice. The winner is determined by comparing the choices and the outcome is displayed. The game also allows the player to play again if they wish to do so. The implementation is simple, easy to understand, and allows for further customization.

Note: This is basic implementation provided in the above bullet points , and it can be improved by adding more functionality such as error handling, providing more interactive user interface and providing more user-friendly way of communicating the result.
